I believe very strongly that the most important role of a leader is to provide focus.

I think this is important to say, because I see many people in leadership positions providing little focus, and instead simply being demanding.

This is the antithesis of leadership. It is equivalent to providing no leadership at all.

This might seem counterintuitive. Surely, to get results you have to push people? So let me explain with a model made of two extremes: Someone being told to do nothing, and someone being told to do everything.

## Extreme 1: Someone being told to do nothing

In the first extreme, take a person with no idea what they want to pursue. Either because they are leaderless (no-one is asking them or telling them to do anything), or they are rudderless (they can’t choose what to do for themselves).

In our simple model this person has no direction. They go nowhere.

Speed = 0.

## Extreme 2: Someone being told to do everything

Compare that with the second extreme, someone told to do everything at once.

We only have a finite amount of time each day to act. Making progress anywhere means making meaningful actions. Meaningful actions take time. If we have too many unclear demands impressed upon us, we never make progress.

Forces acting equally in all directions neutralise each other. Tnx Newton.

Just like the person asked to do nothing. The person told to do everything goes nowhere.

Speed = 0

## The Acme of leadership is focus

The way we actually lead is to give people focus. It is specific. It is “Follow me”.

At any moment, a person can pursue an infinite number of possibilities. Leadership is helping them find the few things they should focus on, so they can spend meaningful time on them, to take meaningful action and make progress towards a goal.

It is the subtraction of ‘everything else’, not the addition of ‘this’, that defines good leadership.

This is focus.

This is hard because it is you, the leader, who takes responsibility for the things that aren’t done.

It hurts. If you fail it’s because you chose the wrong things to focus on.

But it’s the job.

When you don’t do this, when you leave too many possibilities on the table, when you ask for too much to be done at once, you relinquish responsibility for the most important thing you can do, which is to have a clear vision.

It is the act of selecting the essential few activities to realise your vision which separates real leaders from people who are merely in leadership positions.

## Would you like a biased case study?

When Apple re-hired Steve Jobs as CEO in 1997, they were in trouble. His response: cut the product line down to a few important and essential things - focus on quality and innovation.

Jobs was the epitome of a demanding boss. He still started with focus.

His approach turned the company around.

## Further reading:

I am incredibly inspired by Essentialism. A book by Greg McKeown.

I remember in the early days of my current role, listening to the excellent audio version of this book between intense workshops right at the start of our journey.

We had a mountain to climb and an infinite list of to-dos. Taking the themes of this book to heart really helped me focus personally, and I think also to carry those ideas into our work - helping others to focus also.

Have a great week!
