      <description>If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don&amp;rsquo;t deal in lies, Or being hated, don&amp;rsquo;t give way to hating, And yet don&amp;rsquo;t look too good, nor talk too wise:</description>

      <description>I believe very strongly that the most important role of a leader is to provide focus.&#xA;Friends, I used to love Nassim Taleb. Our academic interests are similar, although not quite identical. He enjoys statistics while I enjoy pure mathematics. But we are united by our derivative interest in the philosophy and interpretation of these domains, and in using our rigorous understanding of them to challenge their lazy misapplication elsewhere. He was a trader while I am an investor.</description>
