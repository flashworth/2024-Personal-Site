      <description>I believe very strongly that the most important role of a leader is to provide focus.&#xA;I think this is important to say, because I see many people in leadership positions providing little focus, and instead simply being demanding.&#xA;This is the antithesis of leadership. It is equivalent to providing no leadership at all.&#xA;This might seem counterintuitive. Surely, to get results you have to push people? So let me explain with a model made of two extremes: Someone being told to do nothing, and someone being told to do everything.</description>
