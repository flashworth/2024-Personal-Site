      <description>I believe very strongly that the most important role of a leader is to provide focus.&#xA;Friends, I used to love Nassim Taleb. Our academic interests are similar, although not quite identical. He enjoys statistics while I enjoy pure mathematics. But we are united by our derivative interest in the philosophy and interpretation of these domains, and in using our rigorous understanding of them to challenge their lazy misapplication elsewhere. He was a trader while I am an investor.</description>
